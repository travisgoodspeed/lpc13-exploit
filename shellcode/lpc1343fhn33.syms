/* READ ME CAREFULLY BEFORE PATCHING:

   This file contains the magic constants to exploit bootloader
   version 2.5 of the LPC1343FHN33 bootloader.  Other chips in the
   family are probably vulnerable, but you will need to adjust these
   constants on an unlocked chip in order to crack a locked chip.

   Alignment matters and all functions must be at odd addresses.
